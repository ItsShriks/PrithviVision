## **Initial Commit** (04.06.25, 19:35:54)
- **Commit**: `212cc50`
- **Summary**: Set up the foundation of the project.
- **Details**:
  - Added `.gitignore` (comprehensive Python + IDE ignores).
  - Created a basic `README.md` with project title *Shadow_Casting_Object_Segmentation*.
- **Reflection**:
  This was the project bootstrap stage: preparing the repo with clean version control practices and a placeholder readme.

## **Conda Environment Cleanup** (04.09.25, 10:03:04)
- **Commit**: `20b562e`
- **Summary**: Made the Conda environment file agnostic to local paths.
- **Details**:
  - Removed hardcoded prefixes (`/Users/<user>/anaconda3/envs/dlrv`).
  - Stripped platform-specific build hashes from dependencies.
- **Reflection**:
  Ensured the environment YAML is portable across different machines‚Äîan important step for collaborators and reproducibility.

## **First UNet Training Pipeline** (13.09.25, 00:01:21)
- **Commit**: `fe7cfc9`
- **Summary**: Introduced UNet training logic with evaluation.
- **Details**:
  - Implemented `train_unet.py`: data loader, UNet model (ResNet34 encoder), training loop.
  - Added IoU calculation for validation.
  - Introduced logging, GPU memory tracking, and metrics plotting.
  - Extended `.gitignore` to include `.DS_Store`.
- **Reflection**:
  This was the first functional training setup. The model could train and report validation IoU. Still very raw, but the base loop worked.

## **Adding Inference and Polishing Training** (13.09.25, 00:23:27)
- **Commit**: `74c792a`
- **Summary**: Expanded functionality with inference, modularity, and better documentation.
- **Details**:
  - **`inference_unet.py`**:
    - Loads trained model and runs inference on new images.
    - Outputs prediction mask alongside original image visualization.
  - **`train_unet.py` Updates**:
    - Added `argparse` for configurable paths, epochs, and batch size.
    - Simplified logging (no longer separate log files).
    - Cleaned unused features (GPU memory log, inference timing).
  - **New `unet.py`**:
    - A more detailed training script with logging to file, GPU monitoring, inference speed measurement, and plotting of metrics.
  - **README Overhaul**:
    - Documented goals (shadow-casting object segmentation in aerial imagery).
    - Added inference usage instructions.
    - Highlighted model variety (U-Net, YOLO, Mask R-CNN).
- **Reflection**:
  A major milestone. The project now supports both **training and inference**, is parameterized for flexibility, and has a clear identity with improved documentation.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
	‚Ä¢	Environment Portability:
   	‚Ä¢	Conda environment had hardcoded paths and platform-specific hashes.
   	‚Ä¢	Solution: Cleaned YAML to make it portable across machines.
 	‚Ä¢	Model Training Stability:
  	‚Ä¢	Initial UNet training sometimes crashed due to GPU memory spikes.
  	‚Ä¢	Solution: Added GPU memory monitoring, reduced batch size, and simplified logging.
	‚Ä¢	Inference Pipeline Integration:
  	‚Ä¢	Early training scripts did not support running inference on new images.
  	‚Ä¢	Solution: Created inference_unet.py and modularized scripts for flexibility.
	‚Ä¢	Documentation and Usability:
  	‚Ä¢	Original README was minimal and unclear for collaborators.
  	‚Ä¢	Solution: Overhauled README with usage instructions, project goals, and model descriptions.
